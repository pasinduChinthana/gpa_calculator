##How GPA is calculated in general

The entire number of grade points obtained is divided by the total number of credit hours attempted to compute your grade point average (GPA). Your grade point average could be anywhere between 0.0 and 4.0. The total grade points are divided by the number credit hours attempted to calculate the GPA of the example student.

Please keep in mind that this grading method varies each university. A dynamic calulation mechanism comes in handy in this situation.

##How our solution work

there are simple three steps You need to follow

Lets see how these simple steps works in action

Add Your Letter Grade

To calculate your GPA, you can use either your current letter grade or a grade estimate. You can obtain your grade by contacting your instructor, who will most likely be pleased to provide you with your grade prior to the final report card. You can estimate and choose a grade for the grades you can't check. On a 4.0 scale, grades can range from A+ to F. Select a letter grade from the drop-down menu for each class.

Add Your Class Credits

For each class, enter the grade and credit obtained. For example, if you received an A in a four-credit class, type 4 in the box next to the letter A. Both weighted and unweighted high school classes can be added. On the GPA scale, your weighted classes gain bonus points. Unweighted classes are standard classes with no bonus points.

 Calculate Your GPA
 
Your cumulative GPA is calculated and displayed at the bottom of the class list below. It's that simple to add another semester button! As you add letter grades and class weight, the semester GPA and aggregate cumulative GPA will update at the bottom of the page. You can calculate the aggregate and per semester weighted GPA by adding numerous semesters. If you follow these steps, you'll be well on your way to making your own report card.

You can keep track of your GPA throughout the year to see if you're on pace to meet your educational objectives. When you calculate your cumulative GPA, the feedback you receive will tell you if you need to change your study habits for assignments, reviews, and examinations.

#Commonly Asked Questions (FAQs):
